Version 4.2
Bugfix: Fixed broken "smart delete" operator.
Enhancement: Added logic that treats backslashes specially when escape=bslash, doubling or halving them as necessary to prevent a highlighting or smart delete operation from changing the number of *displayed* backslashes.
Enhancement: Stopped treating CTRL-C cancellation of a highlighting/delete operation as an error.
