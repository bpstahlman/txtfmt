	" generally do common configuration twice, since the standard setup will
	" source b:undo_ftplugin between the loading of syntax and filetype
	" plugins. In order for the mechanism to work properly,

" Note on writing to b:undo_ftplugin <<<
" Regardless of who did the common config, it is ESSENTIAL that only the
" ftplugin write to b:undo_ftplugin, as ftplugin.vim function LoadFTPlugin()
" can run between sourcing of syntax file and sourcing of ftplugin file, and
" when it does, if b:undo_ftplugin exists, it will attempt to unlet both it
" and did_ftplugin. Problem is two-fold. Whatever syntax file has written to
" undo_ftplugin is lost, and worse, did_ftplugin may not exist at that point.
" If it does not, the "unlet" without the ! will generate error! Note: Bram
" said he would fix this in distributed version, but everyone will still have

" Function: s:Move_cursor() <<<
" Purpose: Move the cursor right or left (within the current line) by the
" specified number of characters positions. Note that character positions are
" not always the same as screen columns, and are certainly not always the same
" as byte positions.
" IMPORTANT NOTE: This function was designed to effect the cursor position
" offset specified by the '.' in a fmt/clr spec. Because of the way the
" offsets are calculated in the caller (Insert_tokstr), the raw offset may
" need to be adjusted by one character due to (for example) the impossibility
" of positioning cursor before BOL. The logic for doing this should be
" multi-byte aware. Although such logic could be implemented in this
" function's caller, there is no reason to have it in both functions. The
" logic in Insert_tokstr may be simplified if this function is made simply to
" move as far as possible on the current line in the specified direction, in
" cases in which the offset as specified is too large.
" Note: As a general rule, character positions correspond to screen columns;
" in some cases, however, a single character may occupy multiple screen
" columns (e.g. a tab). Also, there may be cases in which multiple characters
" occupy a single screen column (e.g. a base character followed by combining
" characters).
" Method: Begin moving in the specified direction a single byte at a time.
" Each time a byte position change results in a screen position change of *at
" least* one column, consider that we have moved by exactly one character.
" This strategy ensures that a tab will be considered a single character
" (unless 'virtualedit' is set), as will the combination of a base character
" and its associated combining characters. (Note, however, that such special
" cases should not generally be an issue because this function was designed to
" handle offsets in sequences of txtfmt tokens, which should not include tabs
" or combining characters.)
" Inputs:
" off			- Absolute value specifies number of character positions to
" 				move. Sign specifies the direction:
" 				pos. ==> right, neg. ==> left
" Return: The difference between the number of characters positions we were
" requested to move and the number of character positions we actually moved;
" i.e., zero indicates no problem executing the requested move.
" Error: Not possible. Since this function is used only internally,
" questionable inputs are silently converted to safe ones.

" Function: s:Insert_tokstr() <<<
" Called_from: 'insert' or 'normal' mode mapping
" Purpose: Insert the fmt/clr token sequence specified by tokstr at the cursor
" location. Tokstr should be one of the following:
" -a literal (already translated) token sequence with offset prepended (just
"  as it would have been returned by s:Translate_fmt_clr_spec)
" -an untranslated fmt/clr spec.
" -empty string (in which case, user will be prompted to enter a fmt/clr spec)
" After any required translations, this function ensures that the token
" sequence is inserted into the buffer (at a location determined by 'cmd'
" argument). It accomplishes the token insertion in one of two ways, depending
" upon current mode:
" 'insert': Returns the token sequence to be inserted (since the assumption is
"           that this function has been invoked from an expression register
"           (<C-R>=)).
" 'normal': Uses the specified 'cmd' in conjunction with normal!.
" Originally, this function was also responsible for moving the cursor
" to the inter-token position indicated by the (optional) dot replacing one of
" the commas in the fmt/clr spec. This could be done only because all
" insertions (including ones from 'insert' mode) were accomplished within this
" function using normal! That implementation, however, (specifically, the
" use of normal! from within an insert-mode mapping) caused problems with
" respect to an active count applied to the preceding enter-insert command
" (the one that started the insert from which mapping was invoked). Thus, the
" cursor adjustment functionality has been moved to a separate function
" (s:Adjust_cursor), invoked from the mapping after this function has
" returned. Since the offset governing cursor adjustment is determined within
" this function, we use static variables s:Adjust_cursor_inv_off and
" s:Adjust_cursor_modestr to communicate the information to s:Adjust_cursor.
" Inputs:
" tokstr		- raw (un-translated) fmt/clr spec to insert. If empty, user
"				will be prompted for fmt/clr spec list.
" cmd			- [iIaAoOs] - Vim command used (conceptually, at least) to
" 				insert the token string. Note that in some cases, the current
" 				mode will determine how the tokens are actually inserted.
" literal		- nonzero if the input tokstr comprises an offset followed by
" 				the literal fmt/clr tokens; i.e., if it needs no translation.
" 				(This might be the case if this routine is called from a
" 				user-defined mapping.)
" 				Note: When this flag is set, the input tokstr should be in the
" 				form returned by s:Translate_fmt_clr_spec.
" end_in_norm	- nonzero if it is desired that we end up in normal mode after
" 				map completion. (Most 'insert-token' commands have an
" 				alternate form that causes this flag to be set)
" v:count1		If greater than 1 and mode is normal, indicates the count to
" 				be used with the normal mode command used to insert the
" 				tokens.
" 				Note: Used only when a:1 is not supplied.
" a:1			If supplied, represents the count to be used with the normal
" 				mode command that inserts the tokens. (Needed when this
" 				function is called from a user-map)
" Return: Depends upon mode from which we are called:
" 'insert': Returns the inserted string, since we have been called from an
" expression register (<C-R>=).
" 'normal': Returns an empty string.
" Error: Use echoerr with meaningful error message, as this function is
" generally invoked directly from mapping.
" Assumptions: Cursor position and mode unchanged from when map was invoked

" >>>
" Function: s:Jump_to_tok() <<<
" Purpose: Jumps forward or backwards (as determined by a:dir), to the
" v:count1'th nearest token of type given by a:type ('c'=clr 'k'=bgc 'f'=fmt
" 'a'=any (clr, bgc or fmt)). If 'till' argument is nonzero, jump will
" position cursor one char position closer to starting location than the
" sought token. (This behavior is analogous to t and T normal mode commands.)
" Note: If the map that invokes this function is a visual-mode mapping,
" special logic is required to restore the visual selection prior to
" performing any cursor movement. This is because Vim's default vmap behavior
" is to remove the visual highlighting and position the cursor at the start of
" the visual area as soon as the map is invoked. For the motion mappings that
" call this function, the default behavior is not acceptable.
" Inputs:
" type		1 or 2 chars indicating the type of token sought. Format is as
" 			follows:
" 			[{target-modifier}]{target-type}
"	 			{target-modifier} :=
"	 				b	'begin region' tokens only
"	 				e	'end region' tokens only
"	 			{target-type}
"	 				c = fg color, k = bg color, f = format,
"	 				a = fg color, bg color, or format
" dir		single char indicating direction for search (f=forward, b=back).
" 			Wrap behavior is determined by the 'wrapscan' option.
" till		If nonzero, jump lands cursor not on the token, but just 'before'
"			it (where before indicates the side closest to starting point).
"			'Till' is used because of analogy with Vim's t and T commands in
"			normal mode.
" v:count1	If greater than 1, indicates the number of jumps to be performed.
" 			Allows a count to be used with the invoking mapping when jumping
" 			to the N'th token of a particular type and in a particular
" 			direction is desired.
" a:1		If supplied, represents the count to be used. (Needed when this
"			function is called from a user-map)
" Return: Always return empty string, in case function is called from an
" expression register in insert mode.
" IMPORTANT NOTE: On the use of \%# atom -- When used in search() (i.e.,
" non-interactively), Vim appears to use lookahead to optimize when using
" \%#\@!; however, a '\%#' by itself, or followed by \@=, is NOT optimized.
" (Vim searches the entire file with wraparound before finding the cursor
" position!)
" NOTE: Ideally, if the 'till' flag is set for a backwards search, I would use
" the /e modifier with a ? search begun from normal mode to find the token and
" position the cursor on the character after it. (If token is last char on
" line, cursor would be positioned in first column of following line.)
" However, this can cause problems when tok range includes char code 128. This
" problem can be avoided if search() is used. Unfortunately, search() does not
" permit the /e modifier to be used (and \zs and/or \ze appear to be a bit
" buggy when used just after a newline - e.g., try /\n\zs/ and see what
" happens!). Thus, my strategy for finding the target location when the 'till'
" flag is set is to use search() to find the sought token, employing patterns
" that will match only if the 'till' destination location actually exists. If
" search() finds a valid destination, I then accomplish the 'till' move with a
" subsequent positioning command.

	" token. E.g.,
	" <Bslash><Bslash><Bslash><Tok> would become <Bslash><Tok>, since neither
	" the <Bslash> nor the subsequent <Tok> is significant after the move.

	" is within the old range but not within the new must, by definition, have
	" been escaped (else it would have been translated to the new range).
	" Design Decision: An escape is an escape if it's escaping any txtfmt
