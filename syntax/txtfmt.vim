" Purpose: Create an empty scratch buffer in the current window, hiding

" Vim Idiosyncrasy: Special care must be taken when the current window
" contains an empty, [No Name] buffer; in that case, :hide enew will, by
" default, reuse that buffer for the newly created one (discarding any
" existing buf-local variables). This is problematic, since we need to
" return to the original buffer when we're finished with the scratch
" buffer. Note that in some cases, Txtfmt options may already have been
" stored to buf-local variables in the empty, [No Name] buffer before
" this function is called.
" Solution: Bram suggested adding a blank line to the original buffer to
" ensure it isn't reused. The blank line can be removed in the
" s:Cleanup_scratch_buffer() function.

" in a new window. The problem with that approach was that it fails when

				" Loop Logic: Increase by single indent level each iteration,

				" Combining Cases: Generating term-specific # of tabs/spaces
				" works the same for both cases (i.e., ts < sw and ts > sw);
				" the 2 cases' formulas for LCM, MOD and N are the mirror
				" image of each other (i.e., sw and ts swapped). But since we

				" Loop Termination Note: Conceptually, there's nothing new
				" being generated after # of spaces (ns) first becomes 0 (end
				" of the first row in the examples above). Unfortunately,
				" because of the way regex engines work, we must include
				" additional terms for both sw < ts and sw > ts cases. The
				" difficulty stems from the fact that Vim's regex engine (like
				" many) prefers an earlier alternative, even when it's shorter
				" than a later one. Although we take care to order the
				" pattern terms descending with respect to effective # of
				" spaces, there is a peculiarity w.r.t. the final s{0} term in
				" the earlier examples: namely, because it does not require
				" the presence of spaces after the tab(s), it will match
				" instead of a *longer* match with a greater # of tabs, or
				" even the same # of tabs but more spaces. The problem is that
				" there's no simple way to instruct the regex engine to prefer
				" a match with a higher MOD value when its MOD==0 term comes
				" later in the alternation. Including nearly an extra row of
				" terms in the alternation (i.e., 2 * MOD - 1 terms) fixes
				" this issue at the expense of nearly doubling the # of

" LESSONS LEARNED <<<
" -By default, an item is contained only at top level.
" -containedin=TOP causes an item to be contained not just in top level, but
"  in an item which does not have contained set.
" -When an inner (contained) region is truncated because of a keepend in a
"  containing region, the inner regions highlighting is used up until the
"  point where truncation occurs!!!!! This is not obvious from help. However,
"  it's simple to demonstrate: copy the nested parens example from Vim help
"  as-is, but add the keepend argument to par1 region. Source the file and
"  view text with 3 levels of parens. Colors will be as expected until the
"  first close paren is encountered. It will be colored according to the
"  highlighting of the innermost nested paren region, not the outer as I would
"  have expected.
" -You can use patterns for contains=, containedin=, etc..., but only groups
"  defined at the time the command is executed will be matched! (In original
"  implementation, this is why I ran the Define_syntax() function twice. Now I
"  use clusters.)
" -With keepend, when doing matches for contained groups, the match is
"  performed prior to checking for end of containing group. If containing
"  group ends inside the contained group, the contained group will be
"  truncated, but for purposes of ms=, me=, hs=, he=, the end of the contained
"  group is not altered to reflect the point of truncation!!!!!
" -There is an apparent bug with the way contains= and containedin= work with
"  matchgroup. I have submitted to Vim list, and am awaiting Bram's return
"  from Uganda, at which time he has suggested he will investigate.
" -NOTE: A transparent group inherits the contains= arguments of its
"  containing group! (Can lead to unexpected behavior.)
" -Apparent bug with transparent groups inheriting syntax of contained group,
"  even when the current location in containing group has syntax disabled due
"  to a he=<...>. Example: An empty format region has its open delimiter
"  highlighted as error. The remainder of the region is not highlighted
"  specially. However, when a transparent escape-escapee pair appears inside
"  the empty region, it takes on Error syntax, even though it is past the
"  portion of the empty region highlighted as error.
" -IT IS POSSIBLE to have multiple containedin= attributes in the same group,
"  even where they would appear to conflict.
"  Example: group A may be contained by any group whose name matches
"  MyGroup.*Special; additionally, it may be contained in any group whose name
"  does not begin with MyGroup.
"  containedin=ALLBUT,MyGroup.* containedin=MyGroup.*Special
"  Note that this works because when Vim encounters a containedin, it simply
"  adds the appropriate contains= attributes to the specified containing
"  groups; i.e., a containedin= cannot "rule out" future containment due to a
"  subsequent containedin=.
" E56 - (* operand could be empty) workaround for the following pattern:
" \(ab\)\1*
" which will generate E56 in Vim, even though \1 cannot be empty
" Workaround: \(ab\)\%(\1\@=..\)*
